"Browse through your friends list" is a page that uploads data of users from random generator <a target="_blank" href="https://randomuser.me/">Randomuser.me</a> and displays their photo and additional info after hover.
There are some advertisement blocks on the page. Advertisement is randomly selected from the advertisement array and periodically appears instead of cards.
